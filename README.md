# social-distancing-Using-YOLO-V3-
Overview
This project aims to provide tools and resources to monitor and promote social distancing practices. It leverages computer vision, machine learning, and data analytics to ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines, particularly in public spaces.


Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Utilize computer vision to detect individuals in a video feed and measure the distance between them in real-time.
Alert System: Automatic notifications or alerts when social distancing rules are violated.
Data Analytics: Collect and analyze data on social distancing compliance over time.
Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard to visualize compliance statistics, heatmaps, and trends.
Privacy-Preserving: Ensures the privacy of individuals by anonymizing data and focusing solely on distance measurements.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: For machine learning and object detection models.
Flask/Django: Backend framework for the web application.
React/Vue.js: Frontend framework for the user dashboard.
PostgreSQL/MySQL: Database for storing collected data.
Docker: For containerization and easy deployment.
